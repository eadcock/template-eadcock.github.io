## Where to Begin

So, I'm sitting there with absolutely no idea what I was going to write about. Sure, I understand conceptually what digital interactive art means, but I have little first hand experience with it. But that's a problem for Google to solve, I tell myself, and off I go making general queries about interactive art. I knew I wanted to showcase something recent, within the last year preferably. That's not the discount older art, but I wanted to explore something *now*. At the very least, this constraint pointed me in some direction while I was searching. I came across some fairly interesting pieces, but nothing that cried "Yes! Write about me!" So the search continued until, buried in some random list, I came across this image.

When I think digital interactive art, I think of the massive potential for insane visual experiences, and I gravitate towards the grand. This image, however, took me off guard, because it's not a grand display, yet I was enthralled (and still am!). Of course, I looked more into the art piece, and came across an image that showcases every aspect of the piece at once:

Wow, that is beautiful. This piece is called *[Universe of Water Particles](https://www.teamlab.art/w/waterparticles-transcending/ddp/)* and the mechanics of the piece are thus: digital water particles flow down from the ceiling and pool onto the floor. These water particles are used to generate the lines that are the water. People can interact with the water particles to alter their path. By standing on the floor, water will move around them. Touching the walls will also cause the water particles to bounce off of them, causing the stream to part. Anywhere there is no water, flowers will grow. If water flows over the flowers, the flowers wither away. Well, technically, the flowers are a part of a different artwork, but the two interact with eachother. It's so... simple. In concept, at the very least. But it's mesmerizing, relaxing, meditative, and I love it. The best part though? This isn't even the piece I want to talk about.

## Down the Rabbit Hole

You see, as I was about to discover, *Universe of Water Particles* is a part of one of teamLab's solo exhibitions, which meant there were suddenly a *lot* more pieces I wanted to check out. While all the pieces in that exhibition were interesting, it was a different exhibition that caught my eye. This exhibition opened mid last year and is one of their permanent ones, called *[Fukuoka Forest](https://www.teamlab.art/e/forest/)*. There are two pieces in this exhibition that I really, really like for very different reasons.
